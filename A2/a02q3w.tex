\begin{enumerate}
\item Useless extra data -- time.
Since student's priority is determined on a first-come first-serve basis and students' name are unique, so time is not needed if the IA uses a last-in first-out deque (like the C++ one).
Hence, extra memory is wasted.
\item After 5 minutes of meeting, a student has to be reinserted in the priority queue with the current time, so the heap has to be adjusted in order to fit the heap properties.
So the heap can either do heapify $O(n)$, or just a normal insert $O(\log n)$.
On the other hand, inserting to the end of a deque is $O(1)$.
\item Removal of nodes when student in the middle of queue decides to leave:
The IA has to search the entire heap in order to find the location of the student, which is a $O(n)$ operation.
However, deleting a random node from a deque is also $O(n)$.
\item Also, when a student finish asking questions, his/her node has to be removed from the heap.
Deleting from a heap is $O(\log n)$, whereas deleting from a deque is just deleting the first element, hence $O(1)$.
\item Both heap and deque can get the next element in $O(1)$.
